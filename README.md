# Breast-Tumor-Diagnosis
This project aims to predict tumor cell malignancy from quantitavie features of breast cancer tumor cells. This project uses the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data), which is focused on data specifically gathered using fine needle aspiration, a minimally invasive cell collection technique. The project focuses on comparing preprocessing techniques in addition to three models: Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier. Using the techniques in tumor_diagnosis.ipynb, we were able to achieve accuracies above 95%. All results can be obtained by fully running the tumor_diagnosis.ipynb.
